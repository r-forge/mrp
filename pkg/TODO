* TODO [#A] Change examples to use CCES to predict republican vote (or is there a gay marriage question in it?).
  CCES is redistributable, the prev data are not.
  File: cces-completed1.Rdata (rename to .rda in data dir)
  marriage.ban.mrp <- mrp(marriage.ban ~ state + age + education + income,
  dat=CCES.complete)
** TODO R doc example
  File: cces-completed1.Rdata (rename to .rda in data dir)
  marriage.ban.mrp <- mrp(marriage.ban ~ state + age + education + income,
  dat=CCES.complete)
** TODO Vignette? 
* TODO [#B] Add either pieces of or link to my [[http://sites.google.com/site/malecki/map-notes][map notes]]
* TODO [#B] Is a jags array just an NWayData array, or does it need its own class? It just has an extra dimension of 'sample' (will be same as stan)
