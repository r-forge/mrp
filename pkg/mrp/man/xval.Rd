\title{Run k-fold cross validations on mrp model}
\description{
  Run a (binomial) multilevel regression in survey data for later
  poststratification.
}

\usage{
   \S4method{xval}{mrp}(object, 
        formula, folds, loss.type,
   \dots)
}
\arguments{
    \item{object}{A \code{mrp} object.}  
    \item{formula}{A formula specification for the multilevel model on
   which the k-folds cross validation is run. The default is the formula
   of the \code{mrp} object. The left-hand side should always be
	  \sQuote{\code{response}}. For convenience, the formula is handled by
      \code{update.formula} so that \code{.} indicates the 
      current formula contents on either side of the \code{~}, e.g.,
      \code{.~.+newVar}. The initial default formula is constructed as
      just an intercept term for each of the variables in the main
      formula specification (\code{(1|way1)+(1|way2)} etc.)}
    \item{folds}{Number of folds for cross valiation. Default is 4.}
    \item{loss.type}{Type of loss measure used in cross
   validation. Currently "logloss" is supported.}
    \item{\dots}{Additional arguments to be passed to the multilevel
      regression step, which uses \code{\link[blme]{bglmer}} by default. }
